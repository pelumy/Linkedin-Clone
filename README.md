## Steps to recreate 
 - Create a tab controller with two tabs, first tab should be called Invites and the second tab should be called shout out. Feel free to make use of appropriate image to represent the tab. 
     
 - The first tab should have a navigation controller and embed the first two screens above as viewControllers. The first screen should be the navigation controller root controller and the second screen should segue when any of the cell is clicked.  
     
 - The second tab should have a viewController representing the third screen above.  
     
 - The first and last screens found above should be exact replicas using the same UI controls. 
     
 - The second screen replica should contain only this section of the original screen.
